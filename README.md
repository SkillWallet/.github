# (!) DISCLAIMER (!) 
_SkillWallet is now the [Āut Protocol](https://github.com/aut-protocol). SkillWallet's Contracts, Mobile App and Legacy Communities have been discontinued. You may have a look at the V1 of our contracts here. Our V1 required additional pieces of infrastructure, and we realized it leaned towards potential risks of centralization on the long-term. Our V2 is very well alive and actively developed. See [Āut](https://github.com/aut-protocol) for the current version of our Contract Suite - in production._

# Overview
The SkillWallet is a permissionless, open-source protocol for the creation of universal, self-sovereign Identities - based on Skills instead of personal data. <br/>
It comes as an upgradable, Non-Transferable, Non-Fungible-Token (U-NT-NFT) - and it entiles native sybil-resistant properties. <br/>
Moreover, in order to receive their NT-NFT, individual users need to join a Community/Protocol/Platform. By being part of a Community, they can participate in Gigs/Tasks/Projects, that in return provide them a Reputation Score, visible across the whole network, including the Partners that integrate the SkillWallet package in their existing Contract. <br/>
The sybyl-resistance features, together with the portability of the Skills & Benefits acquired, makes the SkillWallet the complementary missing piece in the Multiverse, and the NFT space at large.
